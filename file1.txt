We estimate the fair value of each stock option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Black-Scholes
pricing
option- models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior,
dividend yield. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option,
and
excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility.
also
We have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock,
those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. Our method of

We expect the largest factors impacting our performance in fiscal 2023 will be the economic health of consumers, the inflationary
environment, and the frequency and severity of disruptions in the supply chain. We anticipate double-digit input cost inflation in fiscal
cost
2023 and are addressing inflation headwinds with Holistic Margin Management (HMM) cost savings and net price realization
generated through our Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability. We are planning for volume elasticities to increase
remain below historical levels and supply chain disruptions to slowly moderate in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 levels.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Third Quarter Results

In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales increased 13 percent and organic net sales increased 16 percent compared to the
period last year. Operating profit decreased 10 percent to $730 million, primarily driven by higher input costs, an increase in selling,
same
general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, a lower net gain on divestitures, and an unfavorable change to the mark-to-
valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating
market
profit margin of 14.2 percent decreased 380 basis points. Adjusted operating profit of $807 million increased 20 percent on a
currency basis, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and an increase in
constant-
SG&A expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 15.7 percent. Diluted earnings per share of $0.92
decreased 15 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.97 increased 17 percent on
constant-currency
 a                  basis compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. See the â€œNon-GAAP Measuresâ€​ section below for a

Cost of salesincreased $327 million to $3,461 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022.
The increase was primarily driven by a $290 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a $10 million
decrease attributable to lower volume. We recorded a $67 million net increase in cost of sales related to the mark-to-market
of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to a $20 million net increase in the
valuation
third quarter of fiscal 2022.

SG&A expensesincreased $196 million to $947 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal

increase

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs  totaled $1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $7 million in the

Benefit plan non-service income    totaled $22 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $27 million in the same period
last year, primarily reflecting an increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return
on plan assets.

Interest, netfor the third quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $98 million, up $12 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily
driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average long-term debt levels.

The effective tax ratefor the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 16.6 percent compared to 16.3 percent for the third quarter of fiscal
2022. The 0.3 percentage point increase was primarily due to certain unfavorable nonrecurring discrete tax items, partially offset
favorable changes in earnings mix by jurisdiction in fiscal 2023. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability
by
was 21.6 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to 21.0 percent in the same period last year (see the â€œNon-

After-tax earnings from joint ventures for the third quarter of fiscal 2023decreased to $13 million compared to $30 million in the

Our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test was performed on the first day of the second quarter of

monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of
time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions

to
rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be

applied
reference rate and are analyzing the impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position.
